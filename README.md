**Viewy**

*Timed Image Viewer*
    
<br>

Viewy is an image viewer which can be used to do timed gesture-drawing drills.
It can also be used as a general image viewer. The images are provided by the
user and are loaded into the program via different menu options.

Viewy includes various ways to position the main window to fit the image or zoom
the image to fit the window.

Included are a few image processing options to help enhance certain images
temporarily; none of the processing modes are permanent.

Sample usage:

1.  Start a new session by clicking on **File \> New Session**

2.  Add a new directory of images (click on the **Include Subdirectories**
    checkbox to include any subdirectories that contain images).

3.  In the interval section of the window, input a minute and/or a seconds value
    then click the **Add** button to add it to the interval queue.

4.  Click the **Start** button to start the session.

5.  Go to **Timed Session \> Pause/Continue** to begin the timer.

6.  The next image will load automatically once the timer reaches the determined
    interval. The progress of the timer can be seen in the timer progress bar at
    the bottom of the window.

7.  If more than one time-interval was queued, it can be switched to by **Timed
    Session \> Next Timed Interval** (shortcut key ‘**S**’) and **Timed Session
    \> Previous Timed Interval** (shortcut key ‘**A**’) to go back.

8.  To edit the folders or timers use **File \> Edit Session**.

9.  To save the current interval go to **File \> Save Session** and pick a file
    name for this session.

10. To load a previously saved session, use **File \> Load Session**.
